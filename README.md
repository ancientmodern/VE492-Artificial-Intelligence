# VE492-Artificial-Intelligence

Welcome to the repo for Summer 2021 VE 492 - Artificial Intelligence.

**For academic integrity, we advise you to thoroughly review the JI Honor Code available [here](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/academic-integrity/honor-code/).**

Inside you'll find the source code for all Projects completed during the term. **Remember to respect academic integrity!!!**

If you just want to learn something instead of earning credits, [Berkeley CS 188](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/) should be a way better choice :)
